## 🦀 Dual-Ecosystem Strategy: Rust Crates + Python Bindings

This is a strategic move for the project's growth. By building the core logic in Rust to power Python extensions, we are effectively creating a **high-performance Rust Crates library** as a byproduct.

### Core-Crate Architecture

Following the proven pattern of **Polars**, **Pydantic v2**, and **cryptography**:

1. **`rusputyn-core`**: Pure Rust crate containing optimized logic
   - Published to **crates.io**
   - Used directly by Rust developers
   - Zero Python dependencies
   - Battle-tested logic with API parity

2. **`rusputyn-py`**: Python wrapper using PyO3
   - Exposes core logic to Python
   - Published to **PyPI**
   - 100% API compatible with original packages
   - Thin binding layer over core

### Why This is a Win-Win

**For Python Developers:**
- Drop-in replacements with massive speedups
- Battle-tested implementations
- Professional maintenance

**For Rust Developers:**
- Access to optimized, production-ready utilities
- Logic parity with world's most popular Python packages
- No need to reinvent the wheel

**For The Project:**
- **Wider collaboration**: Rust community can optimize without touching Python
- **Dual-use logic**: Not just "fixing Python" - building fastest version for *any* language
- **More contributors**: Tap into both Python and Rust ecosystems
- **Better quality**: More eyes, more testing, more improvements

### Publication Strategy

Each package will be available in two forms:

| Package | Python (PyPI) | Rust (crates.io) |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| validators | `validators-rs` | `rusputyn-validators` |
| charset-normalizer | `charset-normalizer-rs` | `rusputyn-charset` |
| python-dotenv | `python-dotenv-rs` | `rusputyn-dotenv` |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Roadmap for Rust Ecosystem

**Phase 1**: Refactor existing packages to core-crate architecture
- Extract pure Rust logic from PyO3 bindings
- Create clean Rust-native APIs
- Publish foundational crates

**Phase 2**: Expand Rust-first features
- Add features useful for Rust developers
- Comprehensive Rust documentation
- Rust-specific benchmarks

**Phase 3**: Cross-pollination
- Python improvements benefit Rust users
- Rust optimizations benefit Python users
- United by high-performance, correctness-first approach

### Technical Note for Developers

> **Building Dual-Purpose Libraries:**
> Every Rusputyn package follows a core-crate architecture. The high-performance logic lives in pure Rust crates (available on crates.io), with thin Python bindings for PyPI. This means you're not just getting a Python speedup - you're getting access to some of the fastest implementations of these algorithms, period.

### Benefits at Scale

**10B+ monthly downloads** across ecosystems:
- Python: Faster startup, better performance
- Rust: Battle-tested utilities, proven at scale
- Both: Shared improvements, unified quality

**Example: validators-rs**
- Python: 15M downloads/month, 51x faster email validation
- Rust: Use the same battle-tested regex logic in your Rust apps
- Win-win: One codebase, two ecosystems
